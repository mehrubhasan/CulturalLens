# CulturalLens-Exploring-Masculinity-and-Femininity-in-Text
This is an ai model which can tell analyzing a certain text wheather it is related to masculity or feminity

hofstede cultural dimension theory has six key dimensions through which the influence of societal norms on behaviour, communication and decision making can be understood. which are
  1.Power Distance index
  2.Indivdualism vs Collectivism 
  3.Masculinity vs Faminity 
  4.Uncertainty Avoidance index
  5.Long Term vs Short terms orientation 
  6. Indulgence vs Restraint

in this project my focus is primarily on Masculinity and Faminity dimension 
    • Masculinity: Associated with traits like achievement, assertiveness, and material success. In text, masculine values may appear as competition, ambition, and individualism.
    • Femininity: Linked to nurturing, care, and quality of life. Feminine texts may emphasize empathy, cooperation, and community.
